Bakery 
 
Time Limit: 15 mins 
 
You are a baker who is selling different types of cakes. Each cake has a different time required to be baked and you can only bake maximum two of each cake. You have a machine that can tell you how many cake you can bake in a given time limit. 
  
The cakes you have and their production time are: 
- Tart: 4200s 
- Pie: 1810s 
- Muffin: 1080s 
- Cookie: 640s 
- Brownie: 1320s 
 
The machine should accept time limit as the input, in the form of integer and formatted as H (hour) m (minute) s (second). For minute and second, the maximum value is 59. 
Write a function that takes the time limit input and returns the possible cake combination according to the time limit.
