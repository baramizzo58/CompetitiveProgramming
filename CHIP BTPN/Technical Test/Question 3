Content:
You are given an array coordinates, coordinates [1] = [x, y], where [x, y] represents the coordinate of a point. Check if these points make a straight line in the XY plane. Three or more points can be considered a straight line if they all form equal slopes.

Conditions:
2 <= coordinates.length <= 1000
coordinates[i].length == 2
-10^4 <= coordinates[i][0], coordinates[i][1] <= 10^4
coordinates contains no duplicate point
