Do u know git? many developers used it to maintain the version of their code.
Sometimes, our code is changing but with Git we know which code has been changed.
Now, I want you to make a simple code to know which text change like git was.

Example:
Input:
CHIP
CHiP
Output:
CH[I|i]P

Input:
Programmer
noobgamers
Output:
[Pr|no]o[gr|bg]am[mer|ers]
