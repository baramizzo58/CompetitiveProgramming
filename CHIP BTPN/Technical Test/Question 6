Pak Dengklek wants to save money for his first car. He puts money in the BTPN bank every day.
He starts by putting in $1 on first day. On the second day until seventh day, he put in $1 more than the day before. Every eighth day (and multiples thereof), he put $1 more money than 7 days before (not $1 more than the day before). Given n, return the total amount of money he will have in the BTPN bank at the end of the nth day.

Conditions:
1 <= n <= 1000

Examples:

Input:
4
Output:
10
Explanation:
1st until 4th day = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10

Input:
10
Output:
37
Explanation:
1st until 7th day = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28
8th until 10th day = 2 + 3 + 4 = 9
Total = 28 + 9 = 37

Input:
20
Output:
96
Explanation:
1st until 7th day = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28
8st until 14th day = 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 = 35
15st until 20th day = 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 = 33
Total = 28 + 9 = 96
